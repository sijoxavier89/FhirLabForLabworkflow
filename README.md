# FhirLabForLabworkflow
Web application which demonstrates fhir lab work flow
This POC demonstrates a unit of lab work flow which is implemented using FHIR. This is a web application where physician can create a patient record and create a request for lab test. The same application can be used by a lab technician who can update the lab test result.  It can also serve as a tool for developers to trace server responses in FHIR format
